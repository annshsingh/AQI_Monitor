/// What? -
/// All of the BLoC classes will conform to this interface.
/// The interface doesnâ€™t do much except force us to add a dispose method.
/// Why? -
/// One small caveat that needs to be kept in mind with streams is that they need
/// to be closed when they are no longer needed, otherwise it can cause a memory leak.
/// The dispose method is where the app will check for this.
